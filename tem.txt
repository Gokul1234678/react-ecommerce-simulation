    High-level plan (what to build, in order)

Core product UI (you already have): list, responsive cards, product detail page.

Search & Sort (client-side).

Cart & Wishlist (per-user): protected by stock rule (rating.count === 0). Persist in Firestore (recommended) or localStorage (quick).

Product detail page with Add-to-Cart / Add-to-Wishlist (respect stock).

Google Sign-In (Firebase Auth). Show My Account menu and persist user info in Firestore users/{uid}.

User Dashboard: Wishlist, Cart (editable), Order History.

Checkout: choose saved address, confirm order â†’ save to Firestore orders with status "On Process".

Admin simulation: /admin page to list all orders and update status to Shipped or Delivered. Users see updates in their order history.

Final: tests, README, push to GitHub
